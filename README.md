# About

The pacemaker design project is a term assignment where we were tasked to develop a pacemaker that was to be programmed using Simulink and Python and was built on the FRDM-K64F ARM development board. The group was split into two sub-teams responsible for either the DCM or Simulink portion of the project. Myself, being apart of the Simulink sub-team, heavily contributed to developing the rate adaptive modes that were used to track activity using the on-board accelerometer. Also, we worked together with the DCM sub-team to implement serial communication in order to transmit and receive information.
